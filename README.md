# LockLogin2
LockLogin2 is the new version of LockLogin. With a better API and more stability

# API
LockLogin API was made to avoid external plugins access it, for security reasons, so no external plugin is<br>
allowed to interact with the most important parts of the API. This helps your server to still safe. Anyway,<br>
LockLogin provides a way for developers to access its API, and that's by the use of modules.<br>
<br>
The LockLogin Modules are an essential part of the LockLogin API as they are the only one whith access to the<br>
plugin API, and the best is that everything that the module does gets logged, in case there's a security breach<br>
it will be easier to determine which module (if any) caused that breach.

You can learn on how to create a module for LockLogin in the [LockLogin wiki](https://reddo.es/karmadev/wiki) or<br>
If you need more help when developing the module, you can have a look at the [LockLogin docs](https://reddo.es/karmadev/locklogin/docs/)
